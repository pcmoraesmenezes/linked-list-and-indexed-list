# List Operations in C++

This repository contains a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic operations on a list. The list operations include inserting elements, removing elements, and printing the current state of the list. The program provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the list.

## Contents

- [list_operations.cpp](list_operations.cpp): The C++ source code file containing the implementation of list operations.
- [README.md](README.md): This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
   - Compile the `list_operations.cpp` file using the following command:

     ```bash
     g++ list_operations.cpp -o list_operations
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program:

     ```bash
     ./list_operations
     ```

3. **Interact with the Menu:**
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to view, insert, remove, or exit the list.

## Features

- **Insertion:** Adds elements to the list, with a check for maximum list size.
- **Removal:** Removes a specified element from the list.
- **Viewing:** Displays the current elements of the list.
- **Menu-Driven:** User-friendly menu for easy interaction.

## Notes

- The list is implemented as an array-based structure with a maximum size defined by `MAX_SIZE`.
- The program utilizes a menu-driven approach to facilitate user interaction.
